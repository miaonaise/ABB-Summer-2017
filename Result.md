### Summary
I find working in all environments comfortable. I like how PythonOCC library totally corresponds to the OCCT library and its more advanced examples provided by Thomas Paviot. One can always use simple FreeCAD examples and then find corresponding functions in PythonOCC and SALOME or vice versa, one will notice that the modules are very similar. FreeCAD has a user friendly interface where you can edit the script, run it and visuazlie the geometry. SALOME has a very nice and organized documentation.

However, PythonOCC's minimalized documentation can be difficult to understand. In FreeCAD, one probably has to rely on examples for learning about modules as it does not have a complete API documentation. Salome is linux orientated and does not specialize in creating CAD geometry and it is therefore difficult to find a good exporting method.

For the purpose of creating CAD geometries, I recommed either PythonOCC or FreeCAD. PythonOCC has the most functionalities and therefore most potential. The limitation of the documentation can be dealed with by understanding the modules through Open Cascade Technology's (OCCT) documention. FreeCAD is the easiest one to begin with and the one with an active forum to find help.

### The end
When I began with the task, I only had basic scripting experience with Python and no CAD experience. As I did not understand the ground concept of geometry building I would rush to examples and use script pieces to build this geometry that I thought could be built with blocks. Eventually I had to look through the API documentation to look for the solution. To understand them I needed to understand how these modules were built. Quickly, I had to return to the beginning of the documentation and again until I can understand it. 4 weeks have gone by, and by the end I have discovered more things that I don't know about than what I have learnt to do.

At least I have produced the geometry from task.
