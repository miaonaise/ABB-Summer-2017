# ABB-Summer-2017
Welcome to my repository. In this repository you will find the work I have completed during my 4 week summer job at ABB Corporate Research Center in Västerås, Sweden. 

## TASK DESCRIPTION
The aim is to produce a parametrized geometry in a script file by using Python API/modules provided by a free CAD software. The task was to research which softwares would be able to fulfill the aim and then compare and evaluate their API/modules.

## HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH MY WORK
After you finish reading this document, please read the following documents in the given order:
1. FreeCAD
2. Onshape
3. BRL-CAD
4. OpenSCAD
5. PythonOCC/Open CasCade
6. SALOME
These are the names of the free CAD softwares.

## RESULT
FreeCAD is the best software for achieving the aim. PythonOCC has a much more extended library. Other softwares have signifciant limitations for achieving the aim.

More info:
- All softwares in the list have Python API for scripting geometry. (i.e. technically speaking, they are all capable of fulfilling the aim. I have only achieved the aim with FreeCAD.)
- Only FreeCAD and PythonOCC has python as its default scripting language. The others have a different default scripting language that runs with their GUI.
- FreeCAD, PythonOCC and SALOME are all based on the Open CASCADE library.
- ANSA supporter recommends not to import geometry in STL files in ANSA.
