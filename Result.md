I find working in all environments comfortable. I like how PythonOCC library totally corresponds to the OCCT library and its examples provided by Thomas Paviot. I can always use FreeCAD simple examples and find the same function in PythonOCC or vice versa. SALOME has a very nice documentation and a nice forum, however it is has the least convenient method for running the scripts especially if one uses windows. 

In my opinion, PythonOCC is the best one. It has most functionalities and therefore most potential. The documentation and examples are relatively difficult to understand due to its lack of description. However, one can study FreeCAD or SALOME's documentation + examples and find the corresponding module in PythonOCC. They are after all, all based on the OCCT library.
