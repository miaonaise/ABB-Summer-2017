# ABB-Summer-2017
Welcome to my repository. In this repository you will find the work I have completed during my 4 week summer job at ABB Corporate Research Center in Västerås, Sweden. 

---THIS DOCUMENT AND REPOSITORY IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION---

## TASK DESCRIPTION
The aim is to produce a parametrized geometry in a script file by using Python API/modules provided by a free CAD software. The task was to research which softwares would be able to fulfill the aim and then compare and evaluate their API/modules.

## MY DOCUMENTATION
There is a directory for all softwares I have looked into. If you want to read my full documentation, I recommend to read them in the chronlogical order I have investigated them:
1. FreeCAD
2. Onshape
3. BRL-CAD
4. OpenSCAD
5. PythonOCC/Open CasCade
6. SALOME
Lastly, I have summarized all results in the "Result.md" file including comparisons of softwares.

Info you probably want to know before starting:
- All softwares investigated have Python API for scripting geometry. (i.e. technically speaking, they are all capable of fulfilling the aim.)
- I have achieved the aim with the following softwares: FreeCAD, PythonOCC
- Only FreeCAD and PythonOCC has python as its default scripting language. The others have a different default scripting language that runs with their GUI.
- FreeCAD, PythonOCC and SALOME are all based on the Open CASCADE library.
- ANSA supporter recommends not to import geometry in STL files in ANSA.
