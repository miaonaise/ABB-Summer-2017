# Onshape

Onshape is a CAD software that operates on an online platform. This makes it easy to share and edit a document with others. All you need to do is create an account at https://www.onshape.com/ and you can begin drawing in your browser. 

The geometry can be scripted using FeatureScript, watch the 90-sec introduction video here: https://cad.onshape.com/FsDoc/
As seen in the link above, tutorials and documentation are fully provided. However, the scripting language is not simple and different from Python.

To script a geometry on Onshape using Python one needs to use API key. The Python API at the moment is very limited. This is the only documentation available: https://github.com/onshape-public/apikey
In my opinion, it is not python-friendly to learn and complicates unecessary things especially if one is new to the concept of creatings apps with API key.

[Onshape Support e-mail replies]

The search result on "Onshape Python" on Google was very limited, so I decided to e-mail Onshape support. You can see the questions and replies in the file "supportreplies.md" in the Onshape directory. I posted the original mails as I do not want to summarize his response incorrectly.
