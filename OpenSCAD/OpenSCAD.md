# OpenSCAD
OpenSACD, the software with the simplest language yet? Yes.
After downloading it at http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html, one can open a new file in OpenSCAD:

The editor is together with the GUI. Once you save the file, the GUI will update automatically.



I did not look further into programming with this software because:
1. I've become familiar with FreeCAD
2. I thought it would be better for the file to be exported in a STEP file.
