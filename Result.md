FreeCAD vs PythonOCC vs SALOME

FreeCAD
- object shape conversions for export + messy export
- not a complete API
- good examples for beginners
- python console in GUI
- can preview scripted geo in GUI without using gui functions

PythonOCC
- direct transfer shape and export
- complete API
- runs through anaconda prompt
- better complicated examples
- must add display functions for preview (not complicated I supposed)


I find working in both environments comfortable. I like PythonOCC library more and its examples. I can always use FreeCAD simple examples and find the same function in PythonOCC or vice versa.
