# ABB-Summer-2017
Welcome to my repository. In this repository you will find the work I have completed during my 4 week summer job at ABB Corporate Research Center in Västerås, Sweden. 

## TASK DESCRIPTION
The aim is to produce a parametrized geometry in a script file by using Python API/modules provided by a free CAD software. The task was to research which softwares would be able to fulfill the aim and then compare and evaluate their API/modules.

## MY DOCUMENTATION]
The softwares I have looked into are listed down below. They each have their own directories and a [SOFTWARENAME].md file which is the main documentation of that software. 
- FreeCAD
- Onshape
- BRL-CAD
- OpenSCAD
- PythonOCC
- SALOME

In FreeCAD.md, PythonOCC.md and SALOME.md, you will find installation instructions, API documentation sources, and how to run your python script.

In Onshape.md, BRL-CAD.md and OpenSCAD.md, you will find description of the software and reasons why they are not the ones for achieving the aim.  

Lastly, you will find evaluation and comparisons of softwares FreeCAD, PythonOCC and SALOME in the Result.md file in the ROOT directory.

Info you probably want to know before starting:
- All softwares investigated have Python API for scripting geometry. (i.e. technically speaking, they are all capable of fulfilling the aim.)
- I have achieved the aim with the following softwares: FreeCAD, PythonOCC and SALOME.
- Only FreeCAD and PythonOCC has python as its default scripting language. The others have a different default scripting language.
- FreeCAD, PythonOCC and SALOME are all based on the Open CASCADE library.
- ANSA supporter recommends not to import geometry in STL files in ANSA.

Please contact me via e-mail (julia970906@gmail.com) if you have any suggestions on improving my documents.

I operate on Windows 10 Version 1703 (for SALOME: Ubuntu 16.04)
