# OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD, the software with the simplest language yet? Yes.
After downloading it at http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html, one can open a new file in OpenSCAD:

The editor is together with the GUI. Once you save the file, the GUI will update automatically.
OpenSCAD have the simplest script language yet. The full library documentation is here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language.

In addition, you can also use Python for OpenSCAD with "SolidPython". Full version of SolidPython documentation is here: http://solidpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ including installation guide. The simplicity of the script is preserved.

I have not installed this software and tried scripting with it because:
1. OpenSCAD file cannot be exported into a STEP file (but it can be exported into STL file)
2. I've become familiar with FreeCAD
