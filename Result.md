### Summary
I find working in all environments comfortable. I like how PythonOCC library totally corresponds to the OCCT library and its more advanced examples provided by Thomas Paviot. One can always use simple FreeCAD examples and then find corresponding functions in PythonOCC and SALOME or vice versa, one will notice that the modules are very similar. FreeCAD has a user friendly interface where you can edit the script, run it and visuazlie the geometry. SALOME has a very nice and organized documentation.

However, PythonOCC's minimalized documentation can be difficult to understand. In FreeCAD, one probably has to rely on examples for learning about modules as it does not have a complete API documentation. Salome is linux orientated and does not specialize in creating CAD geometry and it is therefore difficult to find a good exporting method.

Overall, PythonOCC is the best one in my opinion. It has most functionalities and therefore most potential. The limitation of the documentation can be dealed with by understanding the modules through Open Cascade Technology's (OCCT) documention. Second place goes to FreeCAD as it is the easiest one to begin with. 

Lastly, there is no big difference between these three softwares. They can all do what you want to do, but they all require you to go through frustration of not knowing how to do.
