# ABB-Summer-2017
Welcome to my repository. In this repository you will find the work I have completed during my 4 week summer job at ABB Corporate Research Center in Västerås, Sweden. 

## TASK DESCRIPTION
Aim is to produce a geometry in a script file by using API/modules from a free CAD software. The task was to research which softwares would be able to fulfill the aim and then compare and evaluate their API/modules.
More details:
- Ideal script language: Python 2
- Parameters of the geometry should be easily editable in a Python editor.
- The file format should be readable by ANSA (software used for mesh). 
- (Example) Edit python file (.py) - Run module - STEP file exported - open STEP file in ANSA - a geometry ready for mesh.
- Please see the picture of the geometry I was given to script (**enter image file name**)
